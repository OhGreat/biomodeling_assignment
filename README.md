# Bio-modeling: Usage of PetriNets for Pharmacokinetics modeling

## Intoduction
Following the original paper[[1]](#1), implementation of the proposed model using PetriNets has been achieved, in an attempt to reproduce the results (initially using NONMEM).

___

## Instructions

There are two type of experimental procedures. In order to run the respective experiments:
```
python run_exp1.py
```
```
python run_exp2.py
```

Visualization can be achieved using the provided notebook, which will create all of the graphs using the retrived experimental results. The notebook is 'visualization.ipynb'

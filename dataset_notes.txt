DATASET
ID:  subject (individual) ID. Used to group records together: each ID refers to a sample of generally 5 larvae that are measured together.

TIME: recorded times of dosing events (blood sample collection)

AMT: dose administered (1 if True, otherwise empty)

EVID (EVENT ID):    → 0: observation
                    → 1: dose
                    → 2: special event (resetting compartments by giving CMT negative value) **
                    → 3: reset (model reset to zero), not used

DV: Dependent variable → observed concentration

MDV: Missing DV (1 if missing, 0 otherwise)

CMT: Compartment number:    →  1: dosing compartment
                            →  2: central paracetamol in larva
                    	    →  3: central paracetamol in glucuronide in larva
                    	    →  4: central paracetamol sulfate in larva
                            →  5: excreted paracetamol in medium
                    	    →  6: excreted paracetamol in glucuronide in medium
                            →  7: excreted paracetamol in sulfate in medium

BQL (Below Quantification Limit): observed value falls outside of the calibration curve. Once a larger percentage of these are present in a dataset, it requires accounting for it (not the case here)

XEXP, XEXP2: experiment number (not relevant in this case, sometimes we check for the influence of that)

BLOOD: used in the $ERROR section of the model code, where based on IF statements on the sample matrix (homogenate, blood, medium) the amount or the concentration (amount/central volume of distribution) is predicted.

AGE: is constant (all are 5 days post fertilization), so it’s not used by this model 

** EVID=2 and CMT=-5 empties compartment 5, and a following record with EVID=2 and CMT=5 and DV=0 sets it to zero.
